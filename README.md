# START-Hack
Our repository for START Hack 
This repository contains the code for the project that we made for START Hackathon.
START Hack is Europeâ€™s most entrepreneurial hackathon. 
What differentiates START Hack from other hackathons is our emphasis on fostering entrepreneurial spirit within our participants. 
We strive to spark thinking and creating beyond just this one weekend. 
This is why we encourage students with both business or tech backgrounds to apply!
